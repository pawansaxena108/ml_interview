**Situation:**
At the account level, the operations team noticed inefficiencies in crew standby planning—last-minute changes and flight delays were increasing costs and operational disruptions.

**Task:**
I was tasked with building a predictive solution to optimize standby crew assignments and communicate insights in a clear, actionable format to the business.

**Action:**
I built the **Crew Standby Predictor** from scratch using historical flight and crew data. Key steps included:

* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Identified the most influential factors causing variability in standby predictions:

  * Flight delay probability
  * Crew rest time constraints
  * Last-minute leave requests
    These features explained the majority of prediction variability, allowing us to focus on the biggest operational risks.
* **Stress Testing:** Simulated extreme scenarios, such as multiple simultaneous flight delays or high absenteeism, revealing interesting outcomes—e.g., certain flights consistently triggered higher standby needs, which helped management plan targeted contingencies.
* **Business Communication:** Translated the model outputs into dashboards and visualizations that highlighted risks and actionable recommendations in an easy-to-understand format for operations management.

**Result:**

* Reduced unnecessary standby assignments, improving crew utilization and lowering costs.
* Stress testing ensured the model was robust under extreme scenarios, giving management confidence for contingency planning.
* Sensitivity analysis provided clear focus on high-impact variables, enabling proactive staffing decisions.
* The business could easily interpret the predictions, making the tool a trusted part of daily and strategic crew planning.
