**Situation:**
At the account level, the operations team noticed inefficiencies in crew standby planning—last-minute changes and flight delays were increasing costs and operational disruptions.

**Task:**
I was tasked with building a predictive solution to optimize standby crew assignments, ensure robustness under extreme conditions, and present insights in a clear, actionable format for the business.

**Action:**

* I built the **Crew Standby Predictor** from scratch using historical flight and crew data.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:** Identified the most influential features causing variability in predictions, including flight delay probability, crew rest time constraints, and last-minute leave requests. This helped focus on the highest operational risks.
* **Stress Testing:** Simulated extreme scenarios, like multiple simultaneous flight delays or high absenteeism, to evaluate model behavior under pressure. The test predicted expected outputs under these conditions, revealing which flights and crews were most likely to trigger high standby requirements.
* **Business Communication:** Translated results into dashboards and visualizations, showing risks and actionable recommendations in a format easily understood by operations management.

**Result:**

* Reduced unnecessary standby assignments, improving crew utilization and lowering operational costs.
* Stress testing confirmed the model’s robustness in extreme scenarios, giving management confidence for contingency planning.
* Sensitivity analysis highlighted high-impact variables, enabling proactive decision-making.
* The tool became a trusted part of both day-to-day operations and strategic planning.
