**Sampling techniques** are methods used to select a subset (sample) from a population to draw conclusions or make inferences about the entire population. These techniques are widely used in statistics, research, quality control, and data science.

Here’s a **breakdown of sampling techniques**:

---

### **1. Probability Sampling**

Every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected.

* **a) Simple Random Sampling** – Each member has an equal chance (e.g., lottery method, random number generator).
* **b) Systematic Sampling** – Selecting every *kth* member after a random start.
* **c) Stratified Sampling** – Dividing the population into groups (strata) and randomly sampling from each group proportionally.
* **d) Cluster Sampling** – Dividing the population into clusters (e.g., geographical regions), randomly selecting clusters, and sampling everyone within those clusters.
* **e) Multi-stage Sampling** – A combination of techniques applied in multiple stages.

**Use case:** Surveys, population studies, election polls.

### **2. Non-Probability Sampling**

Not every member has a known or equal chance of selection.

* **a) Convenience Sampling** – Choosing individuals easiest to reach (e.g., volunteers).
* **b) Judgment/Purposive Sampling** – Researcher selects participants based on expertise or specific purpose.
* **c) Snowball Sampling** – Existing participants recruit new ones, often used for hard-to-reach populations.
* **d) Quota Sampling** – Selecting participants to meet predefined quotas for subgroups.

**Use case:** Exploratory research, qualitative studies, or when probability sampling is not feasible.

| Feature              | Probability Sampling              | Non-Probability Sampling         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Bias**             | Low                               | High                             |
| **Cost & Time**      | More                              | Less                             |
| **Generalizability** | High                              | Limited                          |
| **Use**              | Quantitative, statistical studies | Qualitative, exploratory studies |

Would you like me to **focus on one specific method** and explain it with an example?
